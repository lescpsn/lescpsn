#+TITLE: Oh My Emacs Org
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil ^:nil

This is part of [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]].

This file contains configuration for the eminently useful [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]].

Org-mode is for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, doing project
planning, and authoring with a fast and effective plain-text system.
Org Mode can be used as a very simple folding outliner or as a complex
GTD system or tool for reproducible research and literate programming.

For more information on org-mode check out [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][worg]], a large Org-mode wiki
which is also *implemented using* Org-mode and [[http://git-scm.com/][git]].

* Org-mode upgrade
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: org-mode-upgrade
  :END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org 8.0 is the most disruptive major version of Org.

-- http://orgmode.org/Changes_old.html
#+END_QUOTE

So why upgrade? Because it is there, it is the future of org-mode. Second, I
want to export my org files to markdown format, sometimes, and org-mode 8.x
provide a new great export engine, which is one of the most exciting features
of org-mode 8.x, check [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/65574][the mailing list]] for original announcing post. For other
features, check [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-8.0.html][org 8.0 upgrading doc]].

You can get the latest org-mode by =M-x el-get-install RET org-mode=
directly. However, with oh-my-emacs, we need some tricks to make it work.

Oh-my-emacs use =org-babel= from =org-mode= to provide a literate emacs
configuration, so we need to =(require 'org)= just after oh-my-emacs
starts. However, by default, oh-my-emacs will load the builtin =org-mode=
instead of the latest =org-mode= package from =el-get=. To replace the builtin
=org-mode= with the latest =org-mode= from =el-get= when we boot oh-my-emacs
even for the initial oh-my-emacs setup, we need to install =org-mode= just
after =el-get= setup, that means, =org-mode= should be the first package to be
installed via =el-get=, this can be done by putting the following code snippet
to =$HOME/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+NAME: org-mode-upgrade
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(defun ome-org-mode-setup ()
  ;; markdown export support

                              (ome-org-mode-setup))))

* Speed keys
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: speed-keys
  :END:
Speed commands enable single-letter commands in Org-mode files when
the point is at the beginning of a headline, or at the beginning of a
code block.

See the `=org-speed-commands-default=' variable for a list of the keys
and commands enabled at the beginning of headlines.  All code blocks
are available at the beginning of a code block, the following key
sequence =C-c C-v h= (bound to `=org-babel-describe-bindings=') will
display a list of the code blocks commands and their related keys.

* Code blocks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: babel
  :END:
This activates a number of widely used languages, you are encouraged
to activate more languages using the customize interface for the
`=org-babel-load-languages=' variable, or with an elisp form like the
one below.  The customize interface of `=org-babel-load-languages='
contains an up to date list of the currently supported languages.

#+NAME: babel
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((emacs-lisp . t)
   (sh . t)))
#+END_SRC

You are encouraged to add the following to your personal configuration
although it is not added by default as a security precaution.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC

Use =C-c '= to edit the current code block. This brings up a language
major-mode edit buffer containing the body of the code block. Manually saving
this buffer with =<C-x C-s>= will write the contents back to the Org
buffer. You can also set =org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay= to save the base
buffer after some idle delay, or org-edit-src-turn-on-auto-save to auto-save
this buffer into a separate file using auto-save-mode. Use =C-c '= again to
exit.

Since ome adopts [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil]], there's a small annoyance with =org-src-mode=. Just like
other modes, you can type =C-x C-s= (which binds to =org-edit-src-save= in
=org-src-mode= to save your commits), however, typing =:w= (which binds to
=evil-write=) will cause an error since there's no real file that associates
with the current =org-src-mode=. So we have to do some hack to bind =:w= to
=org-edit-src-save=. Check this [[https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/issue/399/issues-with-org-src-mode][bitbucket issue ]]for detailed discussion.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Code block fontification
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: code-block-fontification
  :END:

The following displays the contents of code blocks in org-mode files using the
major-mode of the code. It also changes the behavior of =TAB= to as if it were
used in the appropriate major mode.  This means that reading and editing code
form inside of your Org-mode files is much more like reading and editing of
code using its major mode.

#+NAME: code-block-fontification
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
(setq org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
#+END_SRC

When you use org-mode's inline [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Emphasis-and-monospace.html][markup formatting]], there're some characters
which will make the markup failed, such as the "'"(single quote) and
"`"(backtick) char in Lisp/Scheme/Clojure code. We need to do some hack to
org-mode's parser, check [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16443386/how-to-escape-double-quote][stackoverflow: how to escape double quote?]] and
[[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24169333/how-can-i-emphasize-or-verbatim-quote-a-comma-in-org-mode][stackoverflow: how can I emphasize or verbatim quote a comma in org mode?]] for
two examples.

Besides, I've found that modify ~org-emphasis-regexp-components~ only affect
fontification in org-mode, we need some extra work to make it work with
~org-export~. I've spent almost 1.5 hours to figure out this, even read some
code snippet of org-mode's parser. We need to ~(org-element--set-regexps)~
manually after we modify ~org-emphasis-regexp-components~. Actually,
~(org-element--set-regexps)~ will set some a new value for the hidden variable
~org-element--object-regexp~, which is used to recognize org-mode's "element".

#+NAME: inline-code-block-regexp
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* The Library of Babel
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: library-of-babel
  :END:
The library of babel contains makes many useful functions available
for use by code blocks in *any* emacs file.  See the actual
=library-of-babel.org= (located in the Org-mode =contrib/babel=
directory) file for information on the functions, and see
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.php#library-of-babel][worg:library-of-babel]] for more usage information.

Code blocks can be loaded into the library of babel from any Org-mode
file using the `org-babel-lob-ingest' function.

* Htmlize
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: htmlize
  :END:

[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Htmlize][htmlize.el]] is a package for exporting the contents of an Emacs buffer to HTML
while respecting display properties such as colors, fonts, underlining,
invisibility, etc.

Org-mode can utilize =htmlize= when =org-html-export-as-html= for source code syntax
highlighting if =htmlize= is available.

However, there's a minor problem with oh-my-emacs's default settings of
=rainbow-delimiters-mode=. Functions such as =htmlize-buffer= will report an
error: =htmlize-make-face-map: Wrong type argument: listp,
"rainbow-delimiters-depth-1-face"=, so I do a small hack to overcome this by
using the elisp's =defadvice= utility.

Actually, =rainbow-delimiters-mode= still has some problems within org-mode's
code block, which may be a bug of =rainbow-delimiters-mode=.

#+NAME: htmlize
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defadvice htmlize-buffer-1 (around ome-htmlize-buffer-1 disable)
  (rainbow-delimiters-mode -1)

(ome-install 'htmlize)
#+END_SRC

* Org-LaTeX
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: org-latex
  :END:

Syntax highlighting is really cool when export org-mode files to other
formats. We get syntax highlighting for html by [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Htmlize][htmlize.el]], so what about
\LaTeX{}?

Actually, org-mode has builtin support for syntax highlighting in \LaTeX{},
check the builtin documentation via =C-h v org-latex-listings RET=. Check post
[[http://joat-programmer.blogspot.com/2013/07/org-mode-version-8-and-pdf-export-with.html][1]] and [[http://praveen.kumar.in/2012/03/10/org-mode-latex-and-minted-syntax-highlighting/][2]] for technical details.

Note that the following code snippet works with org-mode 8.x branch. So if you
still use org-mode 7.x, you may need to [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-latex-export.html#sec-12-3][setup manually]].

* Org-export
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: org-export
  :END:

Org-mode has [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html][export facilities]] to export Org documents or parts of Org
documents to a variety of other formats.

However, there're some conventions in different formats, so we need some
[[http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html]["smart" tricks]] to follow these conventions with exporting Org documents to
other formats.

** smart quotes

The differentiation of single quote, double quote, back quote may comes from
the world of \TeX of pre-Unicode eras trying to "improve" the typograph by
using conventions that no longer hold any more[1].

Org mode has builtin support for this "smart quote" feature. You can put a
snippet of ~#+OPTIONS: ':t~ at the start of your Org document, or just turn on
it globally.
