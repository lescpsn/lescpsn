#+TITLE: Oh My Emacs
* Announcement
Hey, emacsers,

I've been inactive on this project for a long long time, sorry about that since
I'm busy on my personal business. And I'm looking for a new maintainer for this
project since I've switched to [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][spacemacs]] recently, and I must say that I'm
really impressed by the work of spacemacs community.

The reason to switch to spacemacs:
- Spacemacs is much more faster than oh-my-emacs due to its lazy-loading feature.
- Spacemacs has the best community among all "dotemacs" project, unfortunately,
  I don't have enough time to foster a community for oh-my-emacs.
- Spacemacs has more packages support, which is called [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers][layers]] in its own words.
- Spacemacs is driven by [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and [[https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/wiki/Home][evil]], two of my favourite and the most
  powerful packages in emacs world, which is the same as oh-my-emacs.

Among all of the above, however, I still prefer oh-my-emacs's org-mode based
literate documentation. It's an amazing experimentation and a wonderful journey
for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]], in a modern way. This is the best part of oh-my-emacs.

And I think it's better for emacs community to put major focus on one great
project, so I think it's time to end this experimentation. And I may contribute
some of the tiny great features of oh-my-emacs to spacemacs, when I have time.
If anybody still has some interest in oh-my-emacs and want to be the new
maintainer, contact me and we can discuss some internal details.

Thanks. Thanks for all PR and contributions for oh-my-emacs. Happy with you in
the last two years.

* Introduction

#+ATTR_HTML: title="Join the chat at https://gitter.im/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs"
[[https://gitter.im/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge][file:https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg]]

It is said that Emacs is "a great operating system, lacking only a decent
editor"[1].

Yes, it is, it really is. In fact, Emacs has basic process control and
management, window and frame management(just like windows manager in modern
Linux desktop environment), programming APIs(yeah, elisp to emacs is what
syscall and glibc to Linux), comprehensive manuals and documentation. The only
limitation with Emacs is your imagination.

You can live in Emacs if you like.

But I won't do that, since I want to watch video with mplayer, surf the
Internet with Firefox/Chrome(not with [[http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/][emacs-w3m]]), listen to music with
[[http://amarok.kde.org/][amarok]]. I use Emacs to do what it is good at, namely, text editing. To me,
coding and writing.

This project was born one day I want to reorganize my messy =.emacs.d=. I've
tried all the famous =.emacs.d= projects(such as [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][prelude]], [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][starter-kit]], etc) but
none of them works the way I want it to.

Then I found [[https://github.com/eschulte/emacs24-starter-kit][emacs24-starter-kit]], I was deeply attracted by its literate way
to organize and embed elisp code in org-mode files, I wanted to make some
contribution to make it a full-blown hacking environment, but I stopped after
I dived into the code a little, since I want:
- Adapt =el-get= instead of the builtin =package.el=, and
- Have a better completion including =auto-complete= and various =ac-sources=
  projects for various programming languages.

The starter kit projects is just starter's kit, what I want is a full-blown
hacker's kit. So I start my own project, [[https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs][oh-my-emacs]], whose name is inspired
by [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][oh-my-zsh]].

* Features
- Better default settings with various eye candy, powerline, scrollbar,
  color-theme, fonts, etc.
- Adopt =el-get= as the default package manager for Emacs, instead of the
  default builtin =package.el=, say goodbye to =./configure; make; make
  install= and explicitly manually management of =load-path=. =el-get= also
  provides automatic documentation management, customizable user's recipe
  support, etc.
- Self-adapted, only install necessary packages when it satisfies the
  prerequisities. You need to install [[http://clang.llvm.org/][clang]] for [[https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang][auto-complete-clang]], for
  example.
- Modular, only load necessary packages as you need.
- Literate, each package has comprehensive documentation or even a tiny
  tutorial with it, together with necessary web links. Say goodbye to old,
  out-dated emacs lisp code from Google.
- Work as expected, completion every where when possible, semantic code
  completion through [[https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete][auto-complete]] with various ac backend, [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] for
  minibuffer completion, etc.
- Full-blown, oh-my-emacs is not another starter kit, it is hacker kit.

* Quick Start
Simple enough, first, ensure you have a good network(Chinese users should get
rid of GFW when possible to avoid many weird problems during first startup);
second, *ensure that you have installed the necessary tools* pointed out by
the *Prerequisites* sections from oh-my-emacs modules. Basically, you need to
install the following packages in you operating system, which is the mandatory
prerequisites of [[file:ome.org][ome.org]]:
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs 24.3+]]
- [[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs][cvs]]
- [[http://subversion.apache.org/][subversion]]
- [[http://mercurial.selenic.com/][mercurial]]
- [[http://git-scm.com/][git]]
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/][make]]
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/][texinfo]]
- [[http://gcc.gnu.org/][gcc]]
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/][automake]]
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/][autoconf]]

Please backup your old =.emacs= and =.emacs.d= before you join the journey:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/xiaohanyu/oh-my-emacs $HOME/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then just fire up your Emacs and make a coffee, and you should have a
full-blown Emacs OS!

** Evil

Note that oh-my-emacs enabled [[http://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil]] by default, you can disable it globally by
=M-x evil-mode=, however, I do recommend you enable it and try to adapt, ah,
finally the Emacs OS get a good editor, evil.

** Helm
You may miss the old =M-x= when you first start with oh-my-emacs, me too,
before I fall in love with [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]]. I highly recommend you to adapt with the helm
way. Believe me, helm will bring you lots of surprise.

There're two key points for helm beginners:
- In normal helm, =TAB= is not used as the traditional completion key. Maybe
  this is the most whirlwind turnaround with helm since so many packages use
  =TAB= for completion. Remember, =TAB= in helm is used to access the helm
  action menu. You may wonder, then, how can I do type completion in helm? The
  answer is, no need to do type completion explicitly. Just type, and helm will
  lead you to the right place. However, oh-my-emacs has binded =TAB= to
  =helm-execute-persistent-action= for you, which will makes you feel like
  home. Type =C-z= for amazing things, and =C-SPC= to select and do some cool.
- oh-my-emacs bind the traditional =C-x C-f= to =helm-find-files= by
  default. You should use =C-l= to go to the precedent directory level instead
  of =DEL=.

* What's in Oh-my-emacs

Now you know why Emacs is "a great operating system, lacking only a decent
editor".

  don't know why.
